"Where complaints are transparent and secure"

### Approach
1. **Ethereum Database Storage**: Utilize smart contracts written in Solidity and deployed on the Test Net via Sepolia for seamless storage of data.
2. **Shareable and Transferable**: Easily share and transfer complaint data while preserving its integrity and authenticity.
3. **Encrypted Data Storage**: Ensure data integrity by storing information in encrypted form, safeguarding it against unauthorized access or tampering.
4. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Strengthen security measures with two-factor authentication, providing an additional layer of protection for user accounts.
5. **Data Filtering**: Enable privileged users, such as administrators, to filter data based on complaint type or authority type, facilitating efficient management and decision-making.
