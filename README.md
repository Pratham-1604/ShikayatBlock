"Where complaints are transparent and secure"

### Approach
1. **Ethereum Database Storage**: Utilize smart contracts written in Solidity and deployed on the Test Net via Sepolia for seamless storage of data.
2. **Shareable and Transferable**: Easily share and transfer complaint data while preserving its integrity and authenticity.
3. **Encrypted Data Storage**: Ensure data integrity by storing information in encrypted form, safeguarding it against unauthorized access or tampering.
4. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Strengthen security measures with two-factor authentication, providing an additional layer of protection for user accounts.
5. **Data Filtering**: Enable privileged users, such as administrators, to filter data based on complaint type or authority type, facilitating efficient management and decision-making.

### Features:
1. **Real-Time Updates**: Stay informed with instant updates through webhooks, ensuring timely response and resolution.

2. **Highlight**: The unique selling proposition (USP) lies in the automatic priority assignment and complaint type detection feature, powered by LLM, which streamlines processes and ensures swift resolution of issues.

3. **Instant Notifications**: Receive timely updates on complaints and applications via SMS or email, keeping stakeholders informed throughout the process.

4. **Automatic Priority Assignment**: Gain efficiency through automatic priority assignment and complaint type detection using LLM (Low-Level Machine Learning).

5. **Traceable Complaint Updates**: Track updates to complaints securely using hashing, maintaining a transparent and immutable record of actions taken.

6. **Multilingual UI**: Our UI is available in English as well as Hindi. This is beneficial for the less privileged people in India
